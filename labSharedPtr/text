Many thousands thousands of years ago this was a world without numbers. Today, using the  same numbers in many different ways, man can build bridges,
skyscrapers, fly off the Earth like a bird, even measure the distance to the Moon. So you see,mathematics and numbers, are very important to life nowadays. Many

two degrees of freedom. To say that a surface is proper means that it does not reduce to a curve. If the jacobians all vanish identically, then the functions x,
y, z are three solutions of a linear homogeneous partial differential equation of the form.
